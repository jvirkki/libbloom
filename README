Introduction
------------
This is libbloom, a simple and small bloom filter implementation in C.

If you are reading this you probably already know about bloom filters
and why you might use one. If not, the wikipedia article is a good intro:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter


Building
--------
The Makefile assumes GNU Make, so run 'make' or 'gmake' as appropriate
on your system.

By default it builds an optimized 32bit libbloom. See Makefile comments
for other build options.

The shared library will be in ./build/libbloom.so

Building optional 'perf_test' target assumes the next tools are available:
- git
- inxi (inxi -m requires make is run by root to use dmidecode)
- lscpu
- perf
- perl


Sample Usage
------------

#include "bloom.h"

struct bloom bloom;
bloom_init(&bloom, 1000000, 0.01);
bloom_add(&bloom, buffer, buflen);

if (bloom_check(&bloom, buffer, buflen)) {
  printf("It may be there!\n");
}


Documentation
-------------
Read bloom.h for more detailed documentation on the public interfaces.
