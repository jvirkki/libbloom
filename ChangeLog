	* Version 2.0
	* The following incompatible changes are introduced in this
	  new major release:
	  - Removed deprecated bloom_init_size() function.
	    It has not been needed since v1.1 but was kept around
	    for compatibility.
	  - Types within struct bloom have changed. Any client code
	    which accesses these directly may need to be updated.
	    Typical client code which does not access the struct bloom
	    fields directly is not impacted by the change.
	* Added bloom_save() and bloom_load()
	* Added bloom_merge()
	* Fix bitfield size computation when number of elements is large.
	* Deprecated bloom_init(). Please migrate to bloom_init2().
	  - bloom_init() will not be removed until at least v3.0
	    so existing code will continue to work as-is. But to take
	    advantage of the higher size limits, migrate to bloom_init2().
